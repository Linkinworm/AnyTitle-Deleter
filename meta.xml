This application deletes (almost) any title and its ticket from your Wii.
The original AnyTitle Deleter was written by tona.
Red Squirrel created the database to identify the titles not just by their ID but by their full name.
MrClick added the database support to make deleting titles as comprehensive as possible.
Use this application to add new or unknown titles to the database.
